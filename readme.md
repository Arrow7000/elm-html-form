# Are We `elm-form-html` Yet?

## Milestone 0: Friday, April 5, 2024

### Features
- THE REALLY BIG FEATURE: what if we just exposed the events??? and didn't even give a shit about html??????????
- [x] make it so that we track whether or not we should display errors
- dropdowns
  - parameterize options into the constructor? or leave up to chance at the callsite - can these compose into the output fieldset?
    - we can do this with selects or datalists so we should do both
- [x] validation, validation, validation

### Administrative

- `elm-review` to make things nice and clean
- slide deck and / or essay
- [x] create new project for `elm-html-form` and move stuff over there
- [x] push to github
- publish on elm packages
- document the bejesus out of it, maybe with elm-book if there's time?

## Everything After Milestone 0
- date picker?
